Yapcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Yapcoin Core is the original Yapcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Yapcoin transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Yapcoin Core, visit [yapcoin.org](https://yapcoin.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Yapcoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/yapcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/yapcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run yapcoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Yapcoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Yapcoin-Core.
